## Building

The makefile requires **GNU** make, which is `gmake` on prime but `make` on
Linux. Running that builds all the binaries. I *strongly* recommend building
with the following settings:

    make OPTIMIZE=1 NATIVE=1

Otherwise, be prepared to wait for a very, very long time for the programs to
run.

Note that these programs require C++14 features, which are avaiable in gcc 4.9
(installed on prime if nothing else.)

## Running

The makefile builds 5 binaries:

 - `main-validate`: related to question 2b
 - `main-tune-epochs`: tests with various epochs
 - `main-tune-degrees`: tests with various polynomial degrees
 - `main-tune-widths`: tests with various Gaussian widths
 - `main-eval`: runs the final evaluation and prints the times and confusion
   matrices

All the programs take no commandline arguments -- they use the
`{train,devel,test}.dat` files generated by the makefile.

## Data

The `optdigits.{tes,tra}` files are straight off the `uci.edu` website, and the
makefile splits them up as described in the handout to give
`{train,devel,test}.dat`.

## SVMs

Note that the scripts in `svm` require the `svm_learn` and `svm_classify`
binaries from SVMLight to be in that directory.
